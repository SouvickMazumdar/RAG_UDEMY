Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, Python emphasizes code clarity through meaningful indentation and a clean syntax that makes it accessible to beginners while remaining powerful for experts. It's dynamically typed, supporting multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming styles.

Python's extensive standard library provides built-in modules for file I/O, system operations, mathematics, and more, enabling rapid development. The language excels in data science and machine learning through libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow. It's also widely used for web development (Django, Flask), automation, scientific computing, artificial intelligence, and backend services.

Key strengths include its versatility, large active community, comprehensive documentation, and rapid development cycle. Python's "batteries included" philosophy means most common tasks can be accomplished without external dependencies. The language runs on multiple platforms—Windows, macOS, Linux—making it highly portable. With its emphasis on readability and developer productivity, Python has become one of the most popular programming languages worldwide, used by organizations from startups to Fortune 500 companies.
