Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that analyze data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions based on that analysis.

Machine Learning has three main types: Supervised Learning (labeled data), Unsupervised Learning (unlabeled data), and Reinforcement Learning (learning through rewards). Applications include image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, fraud detection, autonomous vehicles, and predictive analytics.

Key concepts include training data, features, models, and validation. Popular libraries like scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch make implementing ML solutions accessible. Machine Learning powers modern AI systems, enabling computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, from medical diagnosis to financial forecasting.
